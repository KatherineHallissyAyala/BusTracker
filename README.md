# BusTracker
This project displays a map of Boston and shows animated real-time markers representing MBTA buses currently running.  The map pulls from MBTA data.  The bus icons are labeled to indicate bus seating capacity, and you can't miss them because they bounce.
## HowToRun
Drag the html file to your browser.  Make sure you have the icon files and javascript file stored with the html file.
## Roadmap of future improvements
It might help to include a bus speed label, to inform the user of how soon the bus should arrive.
